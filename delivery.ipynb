    "The raw data from the Gun Violence Archaive is splitted into various datasets. To add everything into a same csv file, we simply used Open Refine and opened all the csv when starting a new project. This way, the multiple csv are automatiqually concatenated, as they all have the same columns. Before doing that, we had to eliminate some of the duplicate rows in the data, as the file `MassShootings_2021.csv` overlaps with the file `GunVioleceAllYears.csv`. Again, we used Open Refine to do so, by making a time facet of the file `MassShootings_2021.csv` and selectig the rows that were already in the `GunVioleceAllYears.csv` file, and then eliminating them.\n",
